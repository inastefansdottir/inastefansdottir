- 👋 Hi, I’m @inastefansdottir (Ína S Stefánsdóttir).
- 👀 I’m interested in graphic design, specifically typography and web design. I am also interested in web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Front-end Development at Noroff.
- 📫 How to reach me - Teams, Linkedin and Email.
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am from Iceland but moved to England to pursue my studies in graphic design at a art university with a scholarship. After a year I realized I wanted to work more with web design (UI/UX, web development, coding) than print-related graphic design. I moved to Norway with my boyfriend and started studying front-end development at Noroff online. It's never too late to change your mind!
